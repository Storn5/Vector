# Vector
A simple 3D game written in C++ with graphics implemented from scratch in DirectX, OpenGL and Vulkan, inspired by X-Wing (1993), Elite (1984) and X4: Foundations

## Roadmap
游릭 - done, 游뚾 - WIP, 游댮 - planned

### Graphics APIs
游뚾 OpenGL 4.6 graphics backend (cross-platform)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 GPU selection similar to the DirectX one

游뚾 DirectX 11 graphics backend (Windows-only)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 Fix nVidia GPU not allowing selecting the screen

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 Make the GPU selection happen in the window instead of the terminal

游댮 DirectX 12 graphics backend (Windows-only)

游댮 Vulkan graphics backend (cross-platform)

### Game Engine
游뚾 Basic engine functionality (wrapper around graphics APIs)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游릭 Creating/closing a window

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游뚾 Loading shaders

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 Creating/moving/destroying 3D objects

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游뚾 Graphics loop (Rendering all objects in 3D environment)

游릭 Configuring settings (command-line args)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游릭 Switch between graphics backends at startup

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 Switch graphics backends at runtime

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游릭 Fullscreen/windowed mode

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;游댮 Resolution

游댮 Replace GLFW and Win32 with a common cross-platform windowing API (SDL, SFML, QT?)

游댮 Retro-style wireframe rendering

### Game
游댮 Spaceship movement in 3 dimensions

游댮 A sipmle GUI with a minimap

游댮 Other spaceships to fight against

游댮 Simple background objects (stars, planets, moons, asteroids)
